# vue-test-monster-game

Based on Lynda tutorial but with additional work and functionality.

Each round a player launches and attack, and the monster attacks back.

Changes to the tutorial:
<ul>
<li>Each round the player receives a point.</li>
<li>3 points enable the player to Heal.</li>
<li>6 points enable the player to launch a Special Attack.</li>
<li>Healthbars change from green to orange to red.</li>
</ul>
